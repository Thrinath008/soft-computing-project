Student Recommendation System
Overview
This project is a Student Recommendation System that leverages machine learning to match students based on their skills, goals, interests, and other attributes. It uses sentence embeddings generated by a pre-trained model to compute similarity between student profiles and search queries. The system consists of a FastAPI backend for processing data and serving recommendations, and a React (Vite.js) frontend for a smooth, user-friendly search experience.
The goal is to help students find peers with similar technical skills, preferred domains, and career aspirations, making it easier to form teams or find collaborators for projects.

Features

Smart Search: Users can input a query (e.g., "Python developer with AI experience") to find matching students.
Similarity Scoring: Displays a match percentage for each recommended student based on profile similarity.
User Profiles: Includes details like name, skills, preferred domains, dream companies, bio, and personality type.
Responsive UI: Clean and modern frontend design, optimized for desktop and mobile.
Fast Backend: Powered by FastAPI for quick and efficient API responses.
Advanced Model: Uses the all-mpnet-base-v2 SentenceTransformer model for high-accuracy embeddings.


Technology Stack
Backend

FastAPI: High-performance Python web framework for building APIs.
Sentence-Transformers: Generates text embeddings for profile matching.
Scikit-learn: Computes cosine similarity between embeddings.
Pandas: Handles user profile data from a CSV file.
Uvicorn: ASGI server for running the FastAPI application.

Frontend

React (Vite.js): Fast and modern JavaScript framework for the user interface.
Axios: Handles HTTP requests to communicate with the backend.
CSS: Custom styles for a polished and professional UI.

Setup Instructions
Prerequisites

Python 3.8+: For the backend.
Node.js 18+: For the frontend.
Git: To clone and manage the repository.

Backend Setup

Navigate to the backend/ directory:cd backend


Create a virtual environment and activate it:python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


Run the FastAPI server:uvicorn main:app --reload

The backend will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

Frontend Setup

Navigate to the frontend/ directory:cd frontend


Install dependencies:npm install


Start the Vite development server:npm run dev

The frontend will be available at http://localhost:5173.


API Endpoints
POST /search/

Description: Searches for students matching the input query and returns the top N results.
Request Body:{
  "query": "Python developer with AI experience",
  "top_n": 5
}


Response:{
  "recommended_users": [
    {
      "name": "Tanya Sharma",
      "known_skills": "AWS, Java, Pandas",
      "preferred_domains": "Edge Computing, Cybersecurity",
      "dream_companies": "Microsoft, Amazon",
      "bio": "I love Robotics and Azure",
      "personality_type": "ENTP",
      "match_percentage": 87.53
    },
    ...
  ]
}



GET /

Description: Returns a welcome message to confirm the API is running.
Response:{
  "message": "Search User API is running ðŸš€"
}




Data Format
The backend uses a CSV file (user_data.csv) to store student profiles. Each row represents a student with attributes like:

user_id: Unique identifier.
name: Studentâ€™s name.
known_skills: List of technical skills.
preferred_domains: Areas of interest (e.g., AI, Web Development).
dream_companies: Companies they aspire to work for.
bio: Short description of the student.
personality_type: MBTI personality type (e.g., ENTP).

Example CSV row:
user_id,name,email,known_skills,preferred_domains,dream_companies,bio,personality_type
u10086,Tanya,tanya180@example.com,"['AWS', 'Java', 'Pandas']","['Edge Computing', 'Cybersecurity']","['Microsoft', 'Amazon']","I love Robotics and Azure","ENTP"


How It Works

Data Processing: The backend loads student profiles from user_data.csv and combines relevant fields (skills, goals, domains, etc.) into a single text string.
Embedding Generation: The all-mpnet-base-v2 model converts profile texts and search queries into vector embeddings.
Similarity Matching: Cosine similarity is computed between the query embedding and all profile embeddings to rank students by relevance.
Frontend Display: The React frontend sends search queries to the backend via Axios and displays results as user cards with match percentages.


Future Improvements

Authentication: Add user login to manage and update profiles.
Advanced Filtering: Allow users to filter by specific skills, domains, or personality types.
Dark Mode: Implement a dark theme for the frontend.
Loading Animations: Add spinners or skeleton loaders for a better UX during searches.
Feedback System: Enable users to rate recommendations to improve the model.
